Hi! I am Andrews Boahen, a Ph.D. Candidate in the [department of Statistics & Probability](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu) at Michigan State University. I am privileged to explore and develop novel methods in computer model calibration and active learning under the guidance of [Dr. Chih-Li Sung](https://chihli.github.io). My research interests span the topics of **Uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inverse problems, Monte carlo inference, active learning** and **optimization under uncertainty** with application areas from computer experiments and engineering sciences to digital twins and mission-critical physical systems.
