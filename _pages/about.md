Hi! I am Andrews Boahen, a Ph.D. Candidate in the [department of Statistics & Probability](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu) at Michigan State University. I am privileged to explore and develop novel methods in computer model calibration and active learning under the guidance of [Dr. Chih-Li Sung](https://chihli.github.io). My research includes **Uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inverse problems, Monte carlo inference, active learning** and **optimization under uncertainty** with application areas from computer experiments and engineering sciences to digital twins and mission-critical physical systems.

Prior to my current position, I obtained a MSc. in Mathematical Sciences with distinction from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences [AIMS-GHANA](https://aims.edu.gh) and graduated with a first class in BSc. Actuarial Science from the [department of Statistics & Actuarial Science](https://www.ug.edu.gh/statistics/home) at the [University of Ghana](https://www.ug.edu.gh). At AIMS-GHANA, my research involved establishing [large deviation principles for telecommunication systems under the boolean model in the $\tau$-topology](https://www.tarupublications.com/doi/10.47974/JIOS-1338), whereas my honors project at the university of Ghana consisted in pricing European put options via genetic algorithm. Both research were conducted under the expert superviosion of [Prof. kwabena Doku-Amponsah](https://www.ug.edu.gh/statistics/news/meet-first-full-professor-probability-theory-university-ghana)
